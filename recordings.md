# Day 2

(Note: In the first session of the second day, I paused the recording during a long running job, and I forgot to resume recording. I missed out around 20 minutes, so I subsequently recorded that missing part. So the session 1 has three parts now. The first two parts relate to the first half, and the third part is the last half).
